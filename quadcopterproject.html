					<h2>Quadcopter Project</h2>
					<p>Goal: To configure and modify a UAV (a quadcopter), to allow First
						Person View (FPV) flight, video recording, control via laptop/Xbox
						Kinect motion controls, and other sensors/peripherals.</p>
						<p>Team: Aaron Kramer, Nick Laurenzano, Joseph Owen </p>

						<p>After looking at a few quadcopters to purchase, we finally decided
							on the Aerosky H100. It is a little over a foot wide in both directions,
							not including the propellors, which have a 10in. diameter. It has a flight
							time of ~10-15 minutes using a 2200mah Lipo battery that came with it
							and a 4000mah Lipo battery that we purchased to run it for longer. We
							have not tested the carrying capacity but estimate it to be around 1000g (2.2lbs).</p>

							<b>5/7/14</b>
							<p>Started experimenting with loading different software onto the
								flight control board of the quadcopter. We found that the quadcopter
								can run a software package called Multi Wii
								 (<a href="http://www.multiwii.com">www.multiwii.com</a>). This open
								 source software works with multiple flight control boards, and 
								 allows for customization for different quadcopter set ups. Being 
								 uncertain about what hardware was in it, we experimented with 
								 various settings trying to get it to function correctly. Unfortunately,
								 though we were able to upload software and the transmitter was
								 communicating with the quadcopter, it would not arm to begin
								 flight.</p>
							<b>5/9/14</b>
							<p>Further looked into customizing the software so that it would function
								correctly with our set up. Since we weren't certain what flight
								control board hardware the quadcopter came with, we decided to open
								up the center so we could see the board itself and hopefully
								identify what it was and how to configure the software to communicate
								with it correctly. Upon opening it up we found:</p>

									<img src="img/quadcopter/quad_07.jpg" width=250>
								</figure>
								<br>
								<p>
								Unfortunately Aerosky outfitted this quadcopter with a generic
								unmarked control board, so this was not helpful. However, by
								connecting the board to my computer and using the diagnostic GUI
								associated with the software package, we finally identified that
								the accelerometer was not reading correctly, causing the quadcopter
								to be unable to arm. By using the CALIB_ACC (calibrate accelerometer)
								feature, we were able to get the quadcopter to turn on and arm
								correctly.</p>
