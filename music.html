					<p>I began playing music around the beginning of elementary school. I
						started out learning organ, and later moved to piano. In fourth grade I
						picked up the saxophone, and have played saxophone ever since. I also
						picked up the clarinet going into high school.</p>
						<p>In elementary school I played in the Concert Band as well as the
							Jazz Band. I played the alto saxophone in both, as well as the bari
							saxophone for a year in jazz band. In middle school I played in the
							Concert Band, Wind Ensemble, Jazz Band, and Pit Band, playing alto
							saxophone for all of those. In high school, I played in the Symphonic
							Band, Wind Ensemble, Jazz Band, Marching Band, Pit Band, and District Band. During those I played
							both the alto saxophone as well as the clarinet. I also got a soprano
							saxophone in my sophomore year, and formed a sax quartet with three
							of my friends. We practiced and arranged to play short pieces at some
							of the band concerts.</p>
							
							<p>Now currently attending college at the University of Maryland, 
								I play saxophone in the University Band. I hope to possibly play 
								in the Jazz Band here as well.</p>
